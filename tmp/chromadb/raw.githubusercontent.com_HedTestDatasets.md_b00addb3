# HED test datasets

The [**hed-examples**](https://github.com/hed-standard/hed-examples) repository contains
a set of HED-annotated datasets in 
[**BIDS**](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/)-compatible format.
These datasets can be useful for:

1. Writing lightweight software tests.
2. Serving as examples of how to incorporate HED into BIDS-structured data.

The datasets have **empty raw data files**.
However, some data headers containing the metadata are still intact.

Datasets that are derived from datasets on [OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org)
are identified by their OpenNeuro accession number plus 's' plus a modifier.
Datasets focused on particular a particular modality may have the modality
prepended to the name.
For example, eeg_ds003645s identifies a reduced dataset derived the EEG data
in OpenNeuro dataset ds003645.
The suffix modifier indicates what this dataset is designed to test.

This dataset was originally released as multi-modal dataset 
[**ds000117**](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds000117) by Daniel Wakeman and Richard Henson.
The dataset events in [**ds003645**](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003645)
have been reorganized from the original and additional events added
from the experimental logs. The dataset includes MEEG and behavioral data.
HED tags have been added.

The dataset is used as a HED case study in:

## BIDS validation

For general information on the `bids-validator`, including installation, configuration, and usage,
see the [bids-validator README file](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-validator/blob/master/README.md).

**Example:** The following command validates the  `eeg_ds003645s_hed` dataset:

```sh
bids-validator eeg_ds003645s_hed --config.ignore=99
```

This example assumes that `npm` and the `bids-validator` npm package
have been installed on the local machine.
The command is run from the directory above the dataset root directory.
The `--config.ignore=99` flag tells the bids-validator to ignore empty data files
rather than to report the empty file error.

For additional information on BIDS validation,
see the [bids-examples](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-examples#readme.md).
